# Malware-Detection
Developed a machine learning-based malware detection system using Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network models to effectively classify and distinguish between benign and malicious software.

1. DATA SELECTION: Here we will get dataset from UCI repository and load it into the system in the form of .csv file and the selection of data happens here.

2. CHECKING MISSING VALUES: Here all the preprocessing activities take place such as checking for missing values, which means the values which are null and this step filters out such null values as shown in figure 8.2. other preprocessing activities include label encoding where it will assign values for each class as 0 or 1

3. BEFORE LABEL ENCODING: Here the system model takes first 20 values and displays it as malware or benign later label encoding is done . If it is malware then it is classified as 1 else 0.

4. AFTER LABEL ENCODING: Here the system model takes first 20 values and displays it as malware or benign later label encoding is done . If it is malware then it is classified as 1 else 0.

5. FUNCTIONAL-1 AUTO ENCODER: The "functional_1" autoencoder model employs a sequence of dense layers to compress input data into a lower-dimensional representation and subsequently reconstruct the original input data.

6. FUNCTIONAL-3 AUTOENCODER: The output of functionoal-3 auto encoder model details the architecture of a neural network, comprising layers such as convolutional and dense layers, with varying output shapes and numbers of parameters, to process and transform input data.

7. PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS: This is a feature selection process where it reduces the number of features based on the priority and importance.

8. CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images, using convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical patterns. It also finds precision sensitivity and f1 score.

9. DISTRIBUTION OF LABELS IN THE DATASET: Here datasets is divided into equal sets of distribution into malware and benig sets where 0 indicate benign and 1 indicates malware.

10. MODEL COMPARISON: Here the system makes a comparision between 2 models that is Random forest and CNN and gives the comparision result .

11. CLASSIFICATION: The model with highest accuracy is chosen for classification of instances as benign or malware.
